# <font color=#FF0000>Business Analysts Missions</font>

As mentioned in the Gantt Chart, Business Analysts are responsible for : 
*	Define the metrics and model insights required (accuracy, precision, recall, number of clusters, ect…)

*	Interpret the results of the metrics, the visulisations, and models. Assignt meaning in a ready to report format. The interpretation, of the models and visulisations should be able to be copy pasted into the report documents

*	Create report theme (colors, basic branding ect)

* We understand the cost in the dataset as the cost of customer acquisition. 
*	We thought about segmenting the store by type. 
* We have 2 main ideas we would like to focus the  data team study on : 
   - Profit: the idea here is to look at the ratio (Revenue-Cost)/Revenue, it would be interesting to understand what factors increase or decrease this ratio. If some         types of stores are more profitable than others, that also mean the stores in question can reinvest more in their business in the opposite of other that may lose         money. 
   - Loyalty: We have a loyalty feature based on different categories (normal, bronze, silver, or gold). The idea is to “measure loyalty”.

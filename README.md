## Project Background Background - What is this file?

This is a Machine Learning (ML) complete lifecycle project for Enterprise Data Science & ML Production (INSY 695). As part of this task we are a team of 7 who are tasked with completing an ML project on a dataset of our choice. There are 10 discrete steps in any data science liefecyle (details in appendix A). **In short this Github Repo is our cumulative work to accomplish a data science project from start to end.**


## Framing the Problem

### *Context*


Advertisements are everywhere. In our post-pandemic world ads invade our physical and virtual space. Simultaneously customers’ attention span has decreased. In this race for attention, the media happens to play a critical role. We are an internal data science team for a convience stroe buisness. Our chain of convenience stores suffered from this crisis and fierce competition. To recover from it, our new CEO wants to open 300 new locations and extend media coverage. Although we have historically been based out of the US we want to expand into Canada. We will assume the markets are similar enough that the US data is directly applicable to the Canadian market. 

We will work to identify growth drivers and better approaches to address our audience with respect to media campaign efficiency. Therefore, our mission will be three-pronged: identify profitable customers’ segments to target, minimize the cost of acquisition of customers (CAC), and analyze the results of our loyalty program. 


### *Problem Statment*


Given the competitive landscape and saturated market, our new CEO who wants to open 300 new locations. Although we have historically been based out of the US we want to expand into Canada. We will assume the markets are similar enough that the US data is directly applicable to the Canadian market. The new CEO is very risk-averse and wants to invest slowly over time, opting to build a baseline customer base by going after low CAC customers

### *Buisness Value*

The advertising landscape has exploded over the last 20 years, leading to an infinite number of media options. However, not all these options will give an equal return on investment (ROI). The data team will help reduce risks by laying a foundation of customer acquisition cost as a function of media. Predicting the ROI and number of customers, the data team is positioned to optimize our costs and supply chain. After successfully predicting we can implement business strategies to go after the segments that build a strong customer base, reduce costs to successfully launch our stores in Canada.

##Additional Context

We, the team are an internal data team for a company that operates a chain of convenient stores. Although we are successful we need to grow internataionally as the US market is saturated. The National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS) demonstrates through their fact sheet that the US is a highly competitive and challenging market to perate in. Therefore sales will plateau eventually unless we act.

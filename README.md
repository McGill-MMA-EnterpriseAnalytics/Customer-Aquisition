**Context**<br>
The objective of the project is to minimize the customer acquisition cost by optimizing media campaigns. Indeed, since the covid pandemic and the surge of programmatic advertising, companies compete against each other to get the publicâ€™s attention and convert it into (long-term) customers. Therefore, customer segmentation is even more crucial nowadays to address the target with the right codes.

Insights from the data teams can be interpreted in the light of the marketing mix to identify how products, prices, promotions and place affect customers.

**Contribution**<br>
The Data Analyst team was responsible for pre-processing the data so that the Data Science team could have a clean dataset for modeling. 

Exploratory data analysis was also done to understand the dataset contents before moving on to heavier tasks.

We also worked with the Business Analyst team to create visualisations that would assist them with their tasks. Based on their feedbacks, the visualisations were updated to reflect the insights they wanted to derive from the data.

Overall, being able to work with these different teams has also helped us in understanding what their work was about, making this project a very good learning experience for us.

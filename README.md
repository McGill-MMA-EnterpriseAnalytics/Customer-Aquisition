# <font color=#FF0000>Modeling Summary</font>

In this project, we tried to segment customers, predict acquisition cost for them, and derive business insights based on the data. 
For customer segmentation, we primarily focused on customers' gender and income but also studied their number of cars, number of children, education level, loyalty club membership, and occupation. 
To build our prediction model, we developed models using different algorithms including linear regression, decision tree regressor, random forest, extra tree, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, and artificial neural networks. Since it is a regression task, we selected the model with the least RMSE, which is extra tree in our case, and did cross validation for this model. It is worth mentioning that we also experimented with different combininations of our features to address the issue of multi-collinearity while keeping the most possible information in the data.
Also, for the causal inference task, we experimented with 'gender', 'member_card' (which refers to customers' loyalty club membership), and 'media_type' (which refers to the type of media used to acquire the customer) as our treatment. It is worth mentioning that in all the cases the target variable for this task has been 'cost', which refers to the customer acquisition cost (CAC).

# <font color=#FF0000>Business Analysts Missions</font>

As mentioned in the Gantt Chart, Business Analysts are responsible for : 
*	Define the metrics and model insights required (accuracy, precision, recall, number of clusters, ect…)

*	Interpret the results of the metrics, the visulisations, and models. Assignt meaning in a ready to report format. The interpretation, of the models and visulisations should be able to be copy pasted into the report documents

*	Create report theme (colors, basic branding ect)

# <font color=#FF0000>Direction of the Project and BA insights</font>
* We understand the cost in the dataset as the cost of customer acquisition. 
*	We thought about segmenting the store by type. 
* We have 2 main ideas we would like to focus the  data team study on : 
   - Profit: the idea here is to look at the ratio (Revenue-Cost)/Revenue, it would be interesting to understand what factors increase or decrease this ratio. If some         types of stores are more profitable than others, that also mean the stores in question can reinvest more in their business in the opposite of other that may lose         money. 
   - Loyalty: We have a loyalty feature based on different categories (normal, bronze, silver, or gold). The idea is to “measure loyalty”.

# <font color=#FF0000>Context</font>

Convenient store are a big part of the economy in North America. Indeed, in the US we can count more than 150,000 convenient store for a total sales of 663.5bn USD. In convenience stores, the sales can be separated into two categories: food and merchandise. The highest-selling product is cigarettes, with sales totaling 56 billion U.S. dollars, followed by beer, with domestic premium brands like Budweiser being the most popular. Snacks and candy are also popular items sold in convenience stores. Potato chips are the best-selling salty snack, and chocolate is the preferred candy. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many U.S. consumers have reduced their visits to convenience stores. A survey conducted in August 2020 showed that over half of millennial and baby boomer respondents reported visiting convenience stores less frequently. Convenient stores have been trying to attract customers back. After improving health safety they are now implementing new advertisment policies such as offering discounts, loyalty programs or media advertisement.

In our project we want to study the advertisement strategies and the cost of acquisition of customers. The idea is to optimize media strategy to minimze the acquisition cost. This includes mnimizing media campaign cost, targeting customers segments that we identify as having the lowest acquisition cost and maximizing customers reach.

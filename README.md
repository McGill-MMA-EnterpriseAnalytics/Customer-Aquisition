# Context



Insights from the data teams can be interpreted in the light of the marketing mix to identify how products, prices, promotions and place affect customers.  

# Contribution

The Product Management Team took over the definition of the problem and the strategy put into context. 

We worked closely with the Data Teams to communicate and adjust the strategy of the project, and with the Business Analyst to interpret the insights with regard to the problem statement. Feedback loops and efficient communication were the keys to deliver a coherent and insightful project.

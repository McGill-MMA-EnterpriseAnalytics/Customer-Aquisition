# Context

The objective of the projet is to minimize the customer acquisition cost by optimizing media campaigns. Indeed, since the covid pandemic and the surge of programmatic advertising, companies compete against each other to get the publicâ€™s attention and convert it into (long-term) customers. Therefore, customer segmentation is even more crucial nowadays to address the target with the right codes. 

Insights from the data teams can be interpreted in the light of the marketing mix to identify how products, prices, promotions and place affect customers.  

# Contribution

The Product Management Team took over the definition of the problem and the strategy put into context. 

We worked closely with the Data Teams to communicate and adjust the strategy of the project, and with the Business Analyst to interpret the insights with regard to the problem statement. Feedback loops and efficient communication were the keys to deliver a coherent and insightful project.

In addition, the Product Team came up with a structured outline for the group and defined the visual chart for the presentation.
